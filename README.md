# sensey-xbee

##Current status
Very Aplha.

###why?
The code for interacting between xbees isn't too hard, but the need to remember all of the cryptic packet contents is pointless.
So here's a python library that tries to do make it all a bit easier without restricting usage.
By the way, if you need a packet type that hasn't been implemented yet just extend one of the basepackets.

###Used libraries
